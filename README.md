# NordicSnippets

NordicSnippets is a collection of bare-metal example code that runs on the nRF51 and nRF52 series of Nordic Semiconductor SoCs.

The idea is that the examples are as simple as possible to showcase how easy it is to use the various peripherals. Therefore all examples are limited to one main.c file, and typically use a minimum set of the features of a given peripheral.

A developer can then use the examples as a basis to create an abstraction layer that fits to his or hers use-case.
